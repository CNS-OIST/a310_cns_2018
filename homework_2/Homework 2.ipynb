    "## 3. Synaptic scaling\n",

    "Use the simulation in the **1 Pyramidal cell + 1 stimulus** part of Tutorial 2 that simulates a cortical pyramidal neuron with the passive membrane and one excitatory synapse that activates at _t_=50 ms.\n",

    "Note that you will need to use `r18_1.distance_from_soma` function to calculate the distance of the synapse from the soma, i.e.,\n",

    "will return the distance of a synapse to the soma in um.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some studies claimed that an amplitude of an EPSP measured _at the soma_ is approximately independent of the input location, because the synaptic conductance increases with the distance (e.g., [Magee and Cook, Nat Neurosci, 2002](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v3/n9/full/nn0900_895.html)). Here we ask you to find how the synaptic conductance should scale to reproduce their results:\n",
    "   1. In the beginning, the synapse is located very close to the soma. Run the simulation with the synaptic conductance `nc.weight[0]`=0.1 nS and record the EPSP amplitude. Then, change the synaptic conductance until you find a conductance value to give an EPSP with an amplitude ~0.2 mV.\n",
    "   2. Move the synapses to several different locations along 1) a basal and 2) apical dendrite, and find a synaptic conductance to evoke the same EPSP of ~0.2 mV. For each branch, try at least four locations, and make sure that at least one of them is very far from the soma (distance > 950 μm). Also, record the distance to the soma from each point.\n",
    "   3. For each branch, plot two graphs: 1) Distance vs. scaled synaptic conductance. 2) Original EPSP amplitude (when `nc.weight[0]`=0.1 nS) vs. Scaling factor (new `nc.weight[0]`/0.1 nS). Does the second graph show a linear scaling (i.e., scaling factor ~ 1/voltage attenuation)?\n",
    "2. Now repeat the same procedure for the EPSP amplitude of about 2 mV (measured at the soma). Does this give you a similar result? If not, discuss why. Here please make sure to try a point that is very far from the soma."

    "Use the simulation in the **1 Pyramidal cell + 2 stimuli** part of Tutorial 2 that simulates a cortical pyramidal neuron with the passive membrane and two synapses, managed by two point process managers. Both synapses activate at _t_=50 ms, and both are set to excitatory ones (e = 0 mV).\n",
    "\n",
    "Run three simulations and record the EPSP traces at the soma: 1) Both synapses are active (EPSP<sub>1+2</sub>), 2) only the first synapse is active (set `nc[1].weight[0]`= 0 to turn off the second synapse; EPSP<sub>1</sub>), 3) only the second synapse is active (set `nc[0].weight[0]`= 0 to turn off the first; EPSP<sub>2</sub>). \n",
    "\n",
    "Do they sum linearly (approximately) , i.e., EPSP<sub>1+2</sub> ≈ EPSP<sub>1</sub> + EPSP<sub>2</sub>? By moving two synapses around, find out in which situation the the summation is approximately linear or not.\n",

    "**Note:** Before you run simulations, make sure that you properly rescale synaptic conductances (as you did in \"Synaptic scaling\") each time so that the EPSP sizes of two synapses are similar."

    "## 5.  Summation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we ask you to reproduce a version of Fig 5.1 in the Koch for the transient synaptic inputs. Use the **1 Pyramidal cell + 2 stimuli**, but make one of the synapses inhibitory by changing the reversal potential (`e`) to -76 mV (Note that this is the same as the resting membrane potential and threfore the synapse will deliver _shunting inhibition_). Also change `tau2`=100 ms and `stim[1].start`=0 ms so that it should activate slowly like GABA<sub>B</sub> synapses from the beginning of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __(Proximal inhibition)__ Place the excitatory synapse to a distal part of a basal dendrite and the inhibitory synapse close to soma. Run simulations with different conductance values, make a plot for the EPSP amplitude as Fig. 5.1A.\n",
    "2. __(Distal inhibition)__ Now move the inhibitory synapse also to a distal part in the _same dendrite_ as the excitatory synapse, and make a plot as 1 (i.e., Fig. 5.1B).\n",
    "3. __(Different branch)__ Move the inhibitory synapse to a different dendrite than the excitatory synapse, and make a similar plot as 1 and 2.\n",
    "4. It is known that parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory interneurons prefer making synapses close to a soma of a pyramidal neuron, whereas other interneurons such as somatostatin (SOM)-expressing neurons are known to prefer dendrites ([Thomson and Lamy, Front. Neurosci., 2007](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/neuro.01.1.1.002.2007)). Discuss what you can predict about the computational roles of different interneurons based on your simulation results (e.g. [Wilson et al., Nature, 2012](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7411/full/nature11347.html))."
