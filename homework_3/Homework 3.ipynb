        "Here we ask you to reproduce Fig. 7.2 and 7.6 in Rinzel and Ermentrout by using the simulation in the part 2 and 1 of the NEURON tutorial 3, a single compartment neuron with the Morris-Lecar mechanism in a voltage clmap and current clamp mode, respectively.\n",

        "1. Find the I-V relation (panel A in Fig. 7.2 and 7.6): first, use the voltage clamp to fix the membrane voltage to a certain value and and read the steady state electrode current that keeps the voltage (`vc.i` in the part 2 simulation). Then, repeat changing the voltage and reading the current. \n",
        "2. How the I-V relation changes with the half-maximum voltage of the K+ channel (`soma.betaw_ml`). Try a few different values from -20 mV to 0 mV.\n",
        "3. Use the simulations in the part 1 (a current clamp mode), to compute the f-I curve (panel B) of a Morris-Lecar neuron with the same sets of the half-maximum voltage (`soma.betaw_ml`) used in 2. Verify the relationship between the I-V relation and firing property. (Hint: you can use `APCount` (https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/py_doc/modelspec/programmatic/mechanisms/mech.html?highlight=apcount#APCount) to count spikes.)\n",
        "3. Try the Hodgekin-Huxley mechanisms (`hh`) instead of the Morris-Lecar, and discuss the result.\n"

        "2. __(Anode break excitation)__ Set the injected current (`ic.amp`) to -0.2 nA, run the simulation, and explain the result.\n",
        "3. Plot the 2D phase plots of voltage and other gating variables. For example, `v` vs `n_hh`, `n_hh` vs `m_hh`, etc. In each plot, draw several trajectories with different injected currents, particularly including the negative ones (as in 2). Which pair of variables are most helpful to understand the system's behavior and how? Is your answer to the question 2 consistent with the phase plots?\n"
