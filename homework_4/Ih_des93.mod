TITLE anomalous rectifier channel
COMMENT
:
: Anomalous Rectifier Ih - cation (Na/K) channel in thalamocortical neurons
:
: Kinetic model of calcium-induced shift in the activation of Ih channels.
: Model of Destexhe et al., Biophys J. 65: 1538-1552, 1993, based on the
: voltage-clamp data on the calcium dependence of If in heart cells
: (Harigawa & Irisawa, J. Physiol. 409: 121, 1989)
:
: The voltage-dependence is derived from Huguenard & McCormick, 
: J Neurophysiol. 68: 1373-1383, 1992, based on voltage-clamp data of 
: McCormick & Pape, J. Physiol. 431: 291, 1990. 
:
: Modified model of the binding of calcium through a calcium-binding (CB)
: protein, which in turn acts on Ih channels.  This model was described in
: detail in the following reference:
:    Destexhe, A., Bal, T., McCormick, D.A. and Sejnowski, T.J.  Ionic 
:    mechanisms underlying synchronized oscillations and propagating waves
:    in a model of ferret thalamic slices. Journal of Neurophysiology 76:

:   KINETIC MODEL:
:
:	  Normal voltage-dependent opening of Ih channels:
:
:		c1 (closed) <-> o1 (open)	; rate cst alpha(V),beta(V)
:
:	  Ca++ binding on CB protein
:
:		p0 (inactive) + nca Ca <-> p1 (active)	; rate cst k1,k2
:
:	  Binding of active CB protein on the open form (nexp binding sites) :
:
:		o1 (open) + nexp p1 <-> o2 (open)	; rate cst k3,k4
:
:
:   PARAMETERS:
:	It is more useful to reformulate the parameters k1,k2 into
:	k2 and cac = (k2/k1)^(1/nca) = half activation calcium dependence, 
:	and idem for k3,k4 into k4 and Pc = (k4/k3)^(1/nexp) = half activation
:	of Ih binding (this is like dealing with tau_m and m_inf instead of
:	alpha and beta in Hodgkin-Huxley equations)
:	- k2:	this rate constant is the inverse of the real time constant of 
:             	the binding of Ca to the CB protein
:	- cac:	the half activation (affinity) of the CB protein;
:		around 1 to 10 microM.  
:	- k4:	this rate constant is the inverse of the real time constant of 
:             	the binding of the CB protein to Ih channels
:		very low: it basically governs the interspindle period
:	- Pc:	the half activation (affinity) of the Ih channels for the
:		CB protein;
:	- nca:	number of binding sites of calcium on CB protein; usually 4
:	- nexp:	number of binding sites on Ih channels
:       - ginc: augmentation of conductance associated with the Ca bound state
:	  (about 2-3; see Harigawa & Hirisawa, 1989)
:
:
:   IMPORTANT REMARKS:
:       - This simple model for the binding of Ca++ on the open channel 
:	  suffies to account for the shift in the voltage-dependence of Ih
:	  activation with calcium (see details in Destexhe et al, 1993).
:	- It may be that calcium just binds to the Ih channel, preventing the 
:	  conformational change between open and closed; in this case one
:	  should take into account binding on the closed state, which is 
:	  neglected here.
:
:   MODIFICATIONS
:	- this file also contains a procedure ("activation") to estimate
:	  the steady-state activation of the current; callable from outside
:	- the time constant now contains a changeable minimal value (taum)
:	- shift: new local variable to displace the voltage-dependence
:	  (shift>0 -> depolarizing shift)
